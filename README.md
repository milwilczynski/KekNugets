# kekNugets
kekNugets is a repository containing nuggets that are used in "kek" projects

## What's included?
So far, there is only one main nuget, which is the "kekBase" project initalizer that provides, e.g., Serilog configuration.
Later on, custom route convection will be added alongside authorization.
